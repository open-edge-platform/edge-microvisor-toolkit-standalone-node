Make sure docker installed and all required settings for docker must be done
NOTE: Ubuntu 22.04 is prefeed OS for build setup.

## Create the hook-os.iso 
## run below command and it will build hook os and generate the hook-os.iso file
## hook-os.iso will be present under $(pwd)/installation scripts/out directory
make iso

## Once hook-os.iso image generated, it will generate other required files as well for bootable usb
## i.e cluster scripts,tiber microvisor image, and hook-os.iso as usb-bootable-files.tar.gz
## we can prepare the bootable USB device for OS installation on Edge node
bootable-usb-prepare.sh is to
   i) Generate the bootable USB device for booting the hook os on RAM and install OS on the edge node.
   ii) Please provide valid inputs for the scripts such as
       usb -> valid usb device with name ex. /dev/sda
       usb-bootable-files.tar.gz -> this will be generated by make iso command

   ex: sudo ./bootable-usb-prepare.sh /dev/sda "usb-bootable-files.tar.gz

   iii) Once script creates the bootable USB device it read for installation.
