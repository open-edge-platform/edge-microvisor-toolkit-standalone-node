# Design Proposal: Cloud init configuration specific to an image

## Abstract

The Edge Microvisor Toolkit Standalone (EMT-S) provides a simplified approach to deploying an Edge Microvisor Toolkit
(EMT) edge. There are use cases where customers would like to use their own image of EMT to be deployed and
configured as part of the provisioning.

To enable this use case, going forward EMT-S installer will support a configuration section that is available for
the user to update before creating the bootable USB. The configuration section will be used to update the
`cloud-init` template for the EMT image that is being provisioned. The configuration can span across OS and Kubernetes.

## Proposal

EMT-S uses a
[config file](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-microvisor-toolkit-standalone-node/blob/main/standalone-node/installation_scripts/config-file)
to collect user inputs during bootable USB creation. These inputs configure settings during the EMT provisioning process.

We propose extending this configuration file to include a dedicated `cloud-init` section. This lets users easily customize
the cloud-init configuration for their EMT imageâ€”such as installing extra packages, enabling services, or running custom
scripts.

- Any changes made in the `cloud-init` section will be automatically applied to the cloud-config file located in
    `/etc/cloud` on the EMT image during provisioning.
- After provisioning, the EMT image will include all user-specified packages and settings.

Below is a sample of the new `cloud-init` section in the config file. Users can edit this section to fit their needs.

## Custom Cloud-Init Section Example

```yaml
#cloud-config

# === Enable or disable systemd services ===
# List services to enable or disable.
# Note : Make sure Services should be part of the Base Image to enable or disable.
# Example:
#   services:
#     enable: [docker, ssh]
#     disable: [apache2]
services:
    enable: []
    disable: []

# === Create custom configuration files ===
# To create a file, specify its path,permission and content.
# Note : you can create as many files(shell,text,yaml) as you wish,just expand the write_files: with prefix -path for next file 
# Note : Make sure scripts/files passing to cloud-init file well tested,if any issues in the script/file error messages 
#        will be present under /var/log/cloud-init-output.log file on EMT image.
# Example:
#   write_files:
#     - path: /etc/cloud/test.sh
#        permissions: '0644'
#       content: |
#         #!/bin/sh
#         echo "This is Example"
write_files: []

# === Custom run commands ===
# List commands or scripts to run at boot.
# Note : Make sure syntax is correct for the commands,if any issues in commands error messages will be present 
#        under /var/log/cloud-init-output.log file on EMT image. 
# Example:
#   runcmd:
#     - systemctl restart myservice
#     - bash /etc/cloud/test.sh
runcmd: []

```

## User Experience

- User creates a bootable USB using the EMT-S USB Installer.
- During creation, the user edits the config file and updates the custom cloud-init section as needed.
- On boot, the installer reads the custom cloud-init section and provisions the EMT host accordingly.
- If invalid values are provided, provisioning may succeed, but cloud-init changes may not be applied correctly on
  first boot.

## Default Behavior

- The custom cloud-init section is **optional**.
- Users can update the section to customize the cloud-init file as needed, or skip it to use default settings.
