# Preparing Bootable USB for Single Edge Node (Windows)

## Introduction

This document explains the procedure to create a bootable USB device for Standalone Edge Node installation.

## Install Ubuntu 22.04 on Windows Subsystem for Linux

### Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

1. Navigate to "Programs and Features" in the Control Panel:

   Press `Win + R` to open the "Run" dialog, type `appwiz.cpl`, and hit Enter.
2. Click on "Turn Windows features on or off."
3. In the list of features, locate and select "Windows Subsystem for Linux".
4. Click OK to apply the changes.

> **NOTE**: A reboot may be required to apply changes to the operating system.

### Install Ubuntu Distribution

1. Open PowerShell in administrator mode by right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator".
2. List available Linux distributions with the following command:

   ```shell
   wsl --list --online
   ```
3. Select `Ubuntu-22.04` from the list and install it:

   ```shell
   wsl â€“install -d  Ubuntu-22.04
   ```
   During installation, you will be asked to provide a username and a password.
4. If prompted by PowerShell, reboot the system after the installation to apply the new changes.
5. Enable Network for WSL:

   Open PowerShell in administrator mode (if applicable) and run the following command:

   ```shell
   Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object Name -Like "*WSL*" | Enable-NetAdapter
   ```

## Install Ubuntu 22.04 in a Hyper-V Virtual Machine

### Enable Virtualization in BIOS

To use Hyper-V Manager on Windows, ensure your system's BIOS settings support virtualization.
Enter the BIOS settings, navigate to the Advanced or CPU Configuration tab.
Search for the virtualization option, usually named *Intel VT-x*, *Intel Virtualization Technology*, or *AMD-V*,
and enable it. Save the changes and exit.

### Enable Hyper-V Manager

1. Navigate to "Programs and Features" in the Control Panel:

   Press `Win + R` to open the "Run" dialog, type `appwiz.cpl`, and hit Enter.
2. Click on "Turn Windows features on or off."
3. In the list of features, locate and select "Hyper-V".
4. Click OK to apply the changes.

> **NOTE**: A reboot may be required to apply changes to the operating system.

### Create Ubuntu Virtual Machine

1. Download the .ISO image for Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish).
2. Start Hyper-V Manager and select *Action-> New-> Virtual Machine*.
3. Provide a name for your VM and press *Next*.
4. Select *Generation 2 (VHDX)*, then press *Next*.
5. Set the desired amount of memory to allocate, then press *Next*.
6. Select a virtual network switch, then press *Next*.
7. Select *Create a virtual hard disk* and one of two options:

   - Select a location for your VHDX and set your desired disk size, then press *Next*.
   - Select *Install an operating system from a bootable image file* and browse to the
      .ISO image.
   - Press *Finish*.

8. Right click your virtual machine from Hyper-V Manager. Select *Settings...*
9. Select *Security* and enable *Secure Boot*. Choose the *Microsoft UEFI Certificate Authority*
   template.

   Enabling Secure Boot and the UEFI template ensures system security as it allows only
   trusted software and prevents malicious code from being loaded during the boot process.

10. Select *Firmware* and adjust the boot order so *DVD Drive* is the first and *Hard Drive*
    is second.
11. Select *Integration services* under *Management* and check *Guest Services*.
12. Click *Apply* to apply all changes.
13. Right click your VM and select *Connect...*. Select *Start*.
14. Follow the installer prompts to install Ubuntu. Then, *Restart* to reboot the machine.
    The installation ISO will be automatically ejected.

## Prepare a USB Drive

### Step 1: Share a USB Drive with Ubuntu

1. Install `usbipd` to share the USB drive with Ubuntu from Windows.

   Make sure to use PowerShell terminal with administrative privileges:

   ```shell
   winget install usbipd
   ```
   Restart the PowerShell terminal.
2. Get the bus number of the USB drive attached to the system:

   ```shell
   usbipd list
   ```
3. Bind the drive using the following command:

   ```shell
   usbipd bind --force --busid <busid for USB Drive>
   ```

### Step 1.1: Start Ubuntu

#### WSL

Run the command in PowerShell:

```shell
ubuntu2204.exe
```
It will ask for the username and password you set previously. Upon successful login,
the Ubuntu terminal will open.

#### Hyper-V

Run Hyper-V Manager, right click your VM, and select *Connect...*. Select *Start*.


### Step 1.2: Attach the drive:

#### WSL

Use PowerShell and run the command:

```shell
usbipd attach --wsl --busid <busid for USB Drive>
```

#### Hyper-V

Start the Ubuntu terminal:


1. Install Usbip tools:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install linux-tools-virtual hwdata
   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/usbip usbip `ls /usr/lib/linux-tools/*/usbip | tail -n1` 20
   sudo modprobe vhci-hcd
   ```

   For more information on the Usbip package, list of available options, troubleshooting,
   etc., refer to the [documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB/IP).

2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo usbip attach --remote=<IPv4 address of host> --busid=<busid for USB Drive>
   ```

   Note that the `usbip attach` command must always be run with root privileges.
   If you encounter `usbip: error: import device`, make sure the VHCI kernel module is
   loaded properly by running `sudo modprobe vhci-hcd`.

   **Now, the USB drive will be mounted in Ubuntu.**

   > **Note**:
   >
   > * If the system reboots, the USB device attachment is lost. You can either
   >   re-attach it after Ubuntu has restarted, or configure the OS to
   >   [automatically re-attach the device](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB/IP#Binding_with_systemd_service).
   > * To quickly obtain the IP address of your host machine, start *Command Prompt*,
   >   and run the following command:
   >
   >   ```shell
   >   ipconfig
   >   ```
   >
   >   It will display the current TCP/IP network configuration, including all IP addresses.
   >   Alternatively, you can use the `ping <name-of-your-computer> -4` command to get only IPv4 address.


In the Ubuntu terminal, verify if the attached USB drive is listed:

```bash
lsusb
```

### Step 2: Create a Bootable USB drive

Follow the [instructions to prepare a bootable USB drive](./user-guide/Get-Started-Guide.md#15--prepare-the-usb-drive).
