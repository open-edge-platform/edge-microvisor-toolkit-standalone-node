# Standalone Edge Node 

The standalone edge node is an edge device powered by the Tiber Microvisor, which can be set up using a USB bootable drive. This installation includes all essential Kubernetes extensions, such as device plugins, scheduler extensions, CNIs, and CSIs. Ultimately, this Tiber Microvisor-based standalone edge node enables customers to deploy their workloads in an independent cluster without requiring an external orchestrator.
