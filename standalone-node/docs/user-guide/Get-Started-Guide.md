# Get Started

The Edge Microvisor Toolkit Standalone Node uses the standard immutable build. You can can
build your own bootable USB from source code, or use the downloadable ISO
image that can be flashed to a USB device and installed on edge nodes. It
installs the microvisor and Kubernetes to the edge node with the essential
functionality to run a single node cluster. The edge node will serve as both the
control and worker node. Additional worker nodes can be added to the cluster
through Kubernetes.

Future releases will enable standalone edge nodes to join an existing Edge
Management Framework backend, deployed on-prem or in the cloud to support scale
out and management of larger infrastructures. The Standalone Edge Node enables
you to quickly get an edge node up and running without deploying backend
services, ready to deploy Kubernetes applications through `kubectl`, `helm`, or
Kubernetes web dashboard.

> **Note**: The standalone edge node does not currently support the real-time version.

## Standalone Node Provisioning

There are two methods of provisioning Edge Microvisor Toolkit for Deployment:

### Creating a bootable USB from downloadable ISO image

You can download the Edge Microvisor Toolkit Standalone Node ISO installer from the
[IntelÂ® Edge Software Catalog](https://edgesoftwarecatalog.intel.com/package/edge_microvisor_toolkit_standalone_node).
Burn the downloaded ISO file to a DVD disc or USB storage and proceed with the steps in the
[Deployment](#standalone-node-deployment) section.

### Creating a bootable USB from Source Code

On Linux based operating systems you can also create a bootable USB drive from source code.
This section provides step-by-step instructions to set up the environment required
for USB-based provisioning for the standalone node.

Source code for the Edge Microvisor Toolkit Standalone Node is available at
[Open Edge Platform GitHub](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-microvisor-toolkit-standalone-node).

Edge Microvisor Toolkit Standalone Node supports installation of EMT image of user choice.
Following EMT images are supported to meet specific needs of edge deployment:

- Edge Microvisor Toolkit Non Realtime image
- Edge Microvisor Toolkit Realtime image
- Edge Microvisor Toolkit desktop virtualization image

By default the installer is packaged with Edge Microvisor Toolkit Non Realtime image.

Users can download the EMT image of their choice and replace the default EMT image in the installer directory before creating the bootable USB.

The diagram below illustrates the steps involved in the USB-based provisioning of the standalone node.

   J --> K[Plug the USB into the edge node and install]
   K --> L[Start using your edge node for your specific use case]
```

> **Tip:** For most users, the default Non Realtime image is recommended. Advanced users can swap in other images as needed.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

#### 1.1: Repository Setup

Begin by cloning the repository that contains all necessary scripts and configurations for deployment. This step
is crucial for accessing the tools required for standalone node

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-microvisor-toolkit-standalone-node
cd edge-microvisor-toolkit-standalone-node
```

#### 1.2: Create the Standalone Installation Tar File

- To create the standalone installation tar file with all required files for preparing a bootable USB device, run the following command

   ```bash
   sudo make build

   ```

> **Note:** This command will generate the `sen-installation-files.tar.gz` file.  
  The file will be located in the `$(pwd)/installation-scripts/out` directory.

#### 1.3:  Prepare the USB Drive

> **Note:**
>
> - Ensure **the correct USB drive is selected** to avoid data loss.
> - **Replace /dev/sdX** with the actual device name of your USB drive.

- Insert the USB drive into the Developer's System and identify the USB disk:

   ```bash
   lsblk -o NAME,MAJ:MIN,RM,SIZE,RO,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT,MODEL
   ```

   > **Note:** Ensure the correct USB drive is selected to avoid data loss.

- Use the wipefs command to remove any existing filesystem signatures from the USB drive.
  This ensures a clean slate for formatting

   ```bash
   sudo wipefs --all --force /dev/sdX
   ```

- Format the USB drive with a FAT32 filesystem using the mkfs.vfat command.

   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX
   ```

- Unmount the USB drive to ensure the creation of bootable USB.

  - Check what is currently mounted:

    ```bash
    df -hT
    ```

  - Unmount the drive:

    ```bash
    sudo umount /dev/sdX
    ```

- Copy standalone installation tar file to developer system to prepare the Bootable USB

  Extract the contents of sen-installation-files.tar.gz

  ```bash
   tar -xzf sen-installation-files.tar.gz
  ```

- Extracted files will include

  ```
  usb-bootable-files.tar.gz
  config-file
  bootable-usb-prepare.sh
  edgenode-logs-collection.sh
  download_images.sh
  ```

- Download the kubernetes artifacts (container images and manifest files). This step is done by executing the ``./download_images.sh`` script. If you are using EMT image with desktop virtualization features then use `DV` parameter. For default EMT image which is a non-Real Time kernel use `NON-RT` parameter.

   ```bash
   sudo ./download_images.sh DV

   or

   sudo ./download_images.sh NON-RT
   ```

> **Note:** By default the script will only pull basic kubernetes artifacts to create a single node cluster.
   ```

- Run the preparation script to create the bootable USB

   ```bash
   sudo ./bootable-usb-prepare.sh /dev/sdX usb-bootable-files.tar.gz config-file
   ```

   ```bash
   Example usage:
   ./bootable-usb-prepare.sh /dev/sdc usb-bootable-files.tar.gz config-file
   ```

  - Required Inputs for the Script:

     ```bash
     - usb: A valid USB device name (e.g., /dev/sdc)
     - usb-bootable-files.tar.gz: The tar file containing bootable files
     - config-file: Configuration file for proxy settings (if the edge node is behind a firewall)
     - Includes ssh_key, which is your Linux device's id_rsa.pub key for passwordless SSH access to the edge node
     - User credentials: Set the username and password for the edge node
     ```

     > **Note:**  Providing proxy settings is optional if the edge node does not require them to access internet services.

## Step 2: Deploy on Standalone Node

- Unplug the attached bootable USB from developer system

- Plug the created bootable USB pen drive into the standalone node

- Set the BIOS boot manager to boot from the USB pen drive

- Reboot the Standalone Node
  This will start the HookOS boot followed by Microvisor installations.

- Automatic Reboot
  The standalone edge node will automatically reboot into Microvisor.

- First Boot Configuration
  During the first boot, cloud-init will install the k3s Kubernetes cluster.

#### 2.1  Login to the Edge Node After Installation complete

Refer to the edge node console output for instructions to verify the kubernetes cluster creation.

Use the Linux login credentials which was provided while preparing the bootable USB drive.
**Note:** If you want to run kubectl commands from the edge node you can use the provided alias ``k`` which is defined in the .bashrc of the user defined in your config.

```
k get pods -A
```

## Step 3: Set up tools on Developer's System

Install and configure [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/) and [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) tools on the Developer's system.

> **Note:** The commands are executed from `Linux` environment, but the same can be achieved from any environment supporting `kubectl` and `helm` by using equivalent commands.

1. Install `kubectl`:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg
   curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.32/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
   sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
   echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.32/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
   sudo chmod 644 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
   ```

2. Copy the kubeconfig file from the Edge Node:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/.kube
   export EN_IP=<EN_IP>
   scp user@${EN_IP}:/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
   ```

3. Update the Edge Node IP in the kubeconfig file and export the path as KUBECONFIG:

   ```bash
   sed -i "s/127\.0\.0\.1/${EN_IP}/g" ~/.kube/config
   export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
   ```

4. Test the connection:

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -A
   ```

5. Install `helm`:

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3
   chmod 700 get_helm.sh
   ./get_helm.sh
   ```

## Step 4: Install Sample Application

Install a WordPress application as a test application using `helm`.

1. Add the `bitnami` repository:

   ```bash
   helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
   ```

2. Create a values override file `values-wp.yaml`, replace the `<pass>` with a password and install WordPress:

   ```yaml
   mariadb:
     primary:
       persistence:
         enabled: false
     auth:
       password: <pass>
       rootPassword: <pass>>
   wordpressUsername: admin
   wordpressPassword: <pass>
   persistence:
     enabled: false
   resources:
     requests:
       cpu: 0m
       memory: 0Mi
   service:
     type: ClusterIP
     annotations:
       service-proxy.app.orchestrator.io/ports: "80"
       external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: "wordpress.example.org"
   ```

   ```bash
   helm install my-wordpress bitnami/wordpress --namespace wordpress --create-namespace -f values-wp.yaml --version 19.4.3
   ```

3. Apply network policy for `wordpress` namespace create a file `wp-net-policy.yaml` and apply.

   > **Note:** This policy opens up all ingress and egress traffic in the namespace - tailor down the allowed traffic per needs of an application in non-test app deployments. By default the ingress and egress traffic is set to be denied.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: wordpress-egress
     namespace: wordpress
   spec:
     egress:
     - {}
     policyTypes:
     - Egress
   ---
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: NetworkPolicy
   metadata:
     name: wordpress-ingress
     namespace: wordpress
   spec:
     ingress:
     - {}
     podSelector: {}
     policyTypes:
     - Ingress
   ```

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f wp-net-policy.yaml
   ```

4. View the pods running

   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n wordpress
   NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
   my-wordpress-d57b44f9c-lw69m   1/1     Running   3 (3m4s ago)   10m
   my-wordpress-mariadb-0         1/1     Running   0              10m
   ```

5. Forward port to be able to access WP

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward --namespace wordpress svc/my-wordpress 8080:80
   ```

6. Access the WP blog from browser using `http://localhost:8080/admin` URL.

7. Login using the `admin` (login) and `password` (`<pass>`) credentials

> **Note:** Edge AI applications from the Edge software catalog can be installed using `helm` and evaluated using similar steps.

## Troubleshooting

1. Creation of USB pendrive failed
The possible reason could be USB device is mounted. Please unmount the USB drive and retry creating the bootable USB drive.

2. If any issues while provisioning the microvisor from Hook OS, automatically logs will be collected
 from /var/log/os-installer.log file on Hook OS what caused the OS provisioning failed.

3. After sucessful installation A banner is printed at the end, summarizing the installation status and
 providing useful commands/logs path for further management.

### Edge Node Logs from Developer's System

### Edge Node IP address

The edge node operates both the Kubernetes control plane and node services, making it a single-node cluster. It is essential to ensure that the IP address of the edge node remains unchanged after deployment to prevent any indeterminate behavior of the Kubernetes control plane.
